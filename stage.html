                    <p>Doff Tap is an independently owned business based in Portland. Whether you feature two or twenty-two taps, properly cleaned lines safeguard the flavor and appearance of your product. Regular line cleaning by Doff Tap will effectively dissolve the organic protein, mold and bacteria that build up over time and alter the finished product. <a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/association-news/importance-draught-beer-line-cleaning/">This article by The Brewers Association</a> breaks down the importance of line cleaning.</p>

                    <h2>Technique</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Doff Tap process uses an electric pump to generate a constant turbulent flow that recirculates cleaning agents throughout the entire draft system.
                        Included with every service appointment, taps are disassembled, scrubbed and thoroughly examined for any irregularities.  Troubleshooting and suggested equipment upgrades are never implemented without consultation and consent.

                    <p>
                        My name is Brian Dufour, I've enjoyed working and growing with Portland&lsquo;s ever changing restaurant industry since 2004.  I&lsquo;m honored to follow in the footsteps of Ken Knepper, who&lsquo;s extensive training has paved the way for myself and several other independent tap cleaners.  My objective is to provide honest service with clear communication and respect for all the moving parts that contribute to a successful operation.
