                    <p>  Whether you feature two or twenty-two taps, properly cleaned lines safeguard the flavor and appearance of your product ensuring a consistent pour every time.  Regular line cleaning by Doff Tap will effectively dissolve the organic protein, mold and bacteria that build up over time and alter the finished product. <a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/association-news/importance-draught-beer-line-cleaning/">This article by The Brewers Association</a> breaks down the importance of line cleaning.</p>

                    <h2>Technique</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Doff Tap process uses an electric pump to generate a constant turbulent flow that recirculates cleaning agents throughout the entire draft system.
                        Included with every service appointment, taps are disassembled, scrubbed and thoroughly examined for any irregularities.  Troubleshooting and suggested equipment upgrades are never implemented without consultation and consent.
